      <p>
      Depending on how hard you workout through the day, you get a measure of calories burned. The more calories you burn, it is beneficial in maintaining vital body functions. This is also a quicker and easier way to maintain your weight. The Amzer FitZer Ka and the Fitbit Charge 2 are good examples of fitness bands that help track efforts you put to burn calories.
