                    Sleep quality has direct effects on your mood and health. There are several fitness trackers such as the Misfit Ray S501BM0BZ monitors your sleep duration and the quality. Some of the new offerings have a sleep tracking feature, which records how much you sleep and it even lets you review sleep stages. This lets you schedule your sleep timings and get you back on track.
